# The friday night

The friday night, Ivy and me swam together the night after 19:00, after that,
we all decide to have something to eat outside. At that moment, I told her:
"perhaps we could make some suchi together at home", and then she told me that
she prefer to eat outside, then I agreed. Then on the way home, we saw
a japanese restaurant which is opened by chinese. Although I am a chinese, but
I don't like the restaurant which is opened by chinese. But I don't want to
depress her, so I said nothing and went inside with her. Then she found that
this restaurant is Chinese and she said: "They are chinese". I know her doesn't
like the chinese restaurt neither, that moment, I said in my heart: "If you
don't like chinese restaurant, then why you still got inside". But I didn't say
anything. After a while, we went home with the food. 

When we returned home, she told me that she want to see something while eating,
I agreed with her and that is exactly what I was thinking about also. As we have seen
downtown abbey a few weeks ago, so I adviced to watch the following episodes.
She was glad also with my advice. Generally, we had a wonderful night, but
because of that, we slept late. While sleeping, I told her that if possible,
can we try to sleep earlier in the future, when these words came out of my
mouth, she was so dispaired, because she thought that I was blamed her,
actually, I confess that I really did that, after a while, I feld so shame and
I want to explain that I was not willing to do that. But it was really hard to change
her mind at that moment.

I reflect on what I did, I read also some article. Finally I found that I was
so mean, I was not gentle like a mature man. I always thought about my self, at
that moment I forgot her, it was too shame to me. As a real man, accept the
capricious of a woman is an important quality.

After write this down, I feld better and I should do better and change myself.
Hope god could bless us.
