I have two cable connected to my pc

1. the internet cable
2. the cable connect to freeserver, the cable could be connected to pc with usb
   adapter

We assume that the internet cable works well, then the focus should be put on
the freeserver connection.

When it is connected to pc, the interface (eth1 - this could be some other name) is not configured, to prove
it, this interface will be shown with 

    $ ifconfig -a

but not with
    
    $ ifconfig

so the first step is to make it works.

### Step 1

[I put one of the answer here that works](http://askubuntu.com/questions/392941/ubuntu-server-wont-recognize-ethernet)

1. add 
    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet dhcp
to /etc/network/interfaces

2. run
    sudo ifup -v eth1

3. use 
    ifconfig 
to confirm that the eth1 is enabled

4. see if the ipaddress of eth1 is in the same network of freebox server

### Step 2

1. Install your freebox-qt from  [here](http://dev.freebox.fr/freebox-qt/) with
   defaut configuration (the plugins of Qt are not necessary)

2. Make sure your qml project could be opend by this version of QtCreator

### Step 3

the library ***libwayland-egl*** should be installed to make sure that
qtcreator could connect the freebox player

    $ sudo apt-get install libwayland-egl1-mesa-lts-trusty

### Step 4

Open your project with QtCreator and wait a little moment until Freebox
appeared in the ***Projects*** Tag

Then change the destination of deployment then run the application
