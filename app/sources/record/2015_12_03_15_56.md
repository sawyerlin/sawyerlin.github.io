# How to use citrix client on ubuntu 14.04 LTS to access splunk service

The installation and configuration are well documented in the this [site](http://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/citrix), I will only resume what should be done for accesing splunk service.

### Installation
----------------
Normally, all the packages for citrix are listed on the end of this [page](http://www.citrix.com/downloads/citrix-receiver/linux/receiver-for-linux-1321.html). It's better to install the last version of **Debian Packages** > **Web Package (Web Receiver only)** > **Receiver for Linux Web client (x86_64)**.

After the installation of package, we need this command to copy ssl certfications to citrix receiver:

    $ sudo cp /usr/share/ca-certificates/mozilla/*.crt /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/keystore/cacerts/

Then tell how to open "ica" file

    $ cat > ~/.local/share/applications/wfica-usercreated.desktop <<EOF
    [Desktop Entry]
    Encoding=UTF-8
    Type=Application
    NoDisplay=true
    Name=wfica
    Exec=/opt/Citrix/ICAClient//wfica
    MimeType=application/x-ica
    EOF

### Configuration
-----------------

The default usage of citrix receiver is full screen and there is no way to get out of it except log off the current session, so it's better to show the client in a window instead of full screen.

There is an official way but it seems that it does not work well, so I advice [another way](http://gonzothegeek.blogspot.fr/2014/05/citrix-receiver-on-ubuntu-1404.html) which works well also:

    $ sudo vim /opt/Citrix/ICAClient/config/All_Regions.ini

Change the value of these two options:

    DesiredHRES=1920 (height resolution)
    DesiredVERS=1080 (width resolution)
    
### Usage
---------

Then you could double click on the "launch.ica" file to open distance server
