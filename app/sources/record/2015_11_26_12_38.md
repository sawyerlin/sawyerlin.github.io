# How to use dnsdock

### What problem could it solve?

When we are using docker-compose, the normal case is that we manage a lot of containers. Each time when the command `docker-compse up` is executed, then the IP(s) of all containers are changed. That is not easy for dev. So I tried to find if we can use domainname to replace the dynamic IP(s).

##### What did I find?

There is a nice [article](http://blog.brunopaz.net/easy-discover-your-docker-containers-with-dnsdock/) which is writted by [Bruno Paz](http://blog.brunopaz.net/). In his article, a docker container [tonistiggi/dnsdock](https://github.com/tonistiigi/dnsdock#setup) is used for manage dns.

##### I won't repeat what they have tought, the things written here just note the problems that I have met, and solution for future projects

* How to add `--dig` and `--dns`

* How to make dnsdock start when host is started

    > sudo touch /etc/init/dnsdock.conf

        # content of dnsdock.conf
        description "Starts dnsdock container to allow DNS quries to docker"
        author "sawyer lin"
        start on filesystem and started docker
        stop on runlevel [!2345]
        respawn
        script
        docker start dnsdock
        end script

* How to test if it works

    > ping dnsdock.docker

* How to solve *DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN* problem if you try to request some
  internal service, like another server which can be accessed by internal DNS,
  then we should point the adress of this nameserver

    > use option *-nameserver*
